## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Real estate investors need a comprehensive platform to track their existing property portfolio in real-time, simulate acquisition and disposal scenarios, and make informed investment decisions based on detailed financial analysis including tax implications, cash flow projections, and key performance indicators.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new user with existing properties, **When** they complete the onboarding wizard, **Then** their portfolio baseline is established with current valuations, loan balances, and rental income
2. **Given** an established portfolio, **When** the user enters monthly transactions (rent received, expenses paid, vacancy periods), **Then** KPIs are automatically recalculated and alerts triggered for deviations
3. **Given** a user considering a new acquisition, **When** they create a "what-if" scenario with property details and financing options, **Then** they can compare the impact on portfolio performance over 5-30 years
4. **Given** a user considering selling a property, **When** they simulate the sale with disposal costs and tax calculations, **Then** they see net cash proceeds and portfolio impact including LTV and DSCR changes
5. **Given** a user with multiple financing options, **When** they simulate refinancing scenarios, **Then** they can compare total costs and portfolio impacts to choose the optimal solution
6. **Given** completed scenarios, **When** users access the comparison dashboard, **Then** they can evaluate up to 5 scenarios using TRI, VAN, cumulative cash flow, and risk metrics

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to delete a property with active loan balances and historical transactions?
- How does the system handle negative cash flow months and portfolio-level covenant breaches?
- What validation occurs for unrealistic property valuations or rental yields?
- How are tax calculations handled across fiscal year boundaries?
- What happens when loan terms change mid-period (rate adjustments, early repayment penalties)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
